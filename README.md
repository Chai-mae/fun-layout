**Introduction**

Qt includes a set of layout management classes that are used to describe how widgets are laid out in an application's user interface. These layouts automatically position and resize widgets when the amount of space available for them changes, ensuring that they are consistently arranged and that the user interface as a whole remains usable.

There is lot of layouts but in our tp we will focus just on :

                               QHBoxLayout:Lines up widgets horizontally
                               QVBoxLayout:Lines up widgets vertically
                               QFormLayout :Manages forms of input widgets and their associated labels
                               QGridLayout:Lays out widgets in a grid
